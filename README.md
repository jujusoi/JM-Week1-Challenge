# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

This project aims to provide essential information on digital marketing, which is widely used in the modern age. Many businesses today have yet to tap into the potential of the digital world, making it challenging for them to understand how to shape their business effectively. To address this, I set out to create a website that not only presents this information, but also incorporates aesthetic and functional elements to ensure user-friendly navigation.

Despite being pre-built, I made various improvements to enhance its coherence. This included fixing positions, adding semantic HTML elements, incorporating image alt attributes, and providing comments throughout the code. I also altered CSS code to narrow selectors and optimize performance.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Upon visiting the website, users see a navigation banner and a hero image. The navigation allows users to access different content by clicking on the respective links. Each link takes the user to a specific element where they can read and gain knowledge about the topic. Users can also scroll past the hero image to view content themselves.
